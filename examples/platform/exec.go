// TaskRunner runs a batch of independent tasks, invoking each one exactly
// once and passing it a context.Context. An implementation must block until
// every task has completed.
//
// Each task receives a context so the runner can give it its own per-task
// context rather than sharing one. The default runner passes the same ctx it
// was given to every task; a custom runner may instead derive a distinct
// context per task.
//
// The default runner (used when none is installed on the context) runs the
// tasks concurrently, one goroutine per task. A caller that wants to control
// how the fan-out executes — for example to bound concurrency, dispatch onto
// its own executor, or run the tasks sequentially in a single goroutine — can
// install its own runner with WithTaskRunner.

// environment substitute its own execution strategy for ADK's internal fan-out
// without the ADK runtime taking a dependency on that environment.

// ctx carries a TaskRunner installed with WithTaskRunner, that runner is used;
// otherwise RunTasks runs the tasks concurrently on one goroutine each.
//
// Each task is invoked with a context.Context. Under the default runner every
// task receives ctx; an installed runner may instead pass each task its own
// per-task context. Under the default runner, the tasks run concurrently and
// must be safe to do so. An empty or nil slice returns without doing anything.
//
// RunTasks enforces the completion barrier itself rather than relying on the
// runner: it wraps each task to signal a sync.WaitGroup on return and waits on
// that group after the runner returns. Callers may therefore read per-task
// results as soon as RunTasks returns, even if a custom runner does not block
// until its tasks finish.
